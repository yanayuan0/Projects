This program is a completed route-building railway game for two players implemented mainly by GUI, top-down design, graph ADTs. The algorithms of graphs include depth-first search, breadth-first search, and Dijkstra's algorithm. The player wins by gaining more points from declaring routes to connect two particular cities given by the system, and certain rules are set to constrain their choices of routes such as limited points and the competition of selecting routes between the players. 

Example command: ./railway test_data/Europe

Concepts included:
- practicing top-down design
- designing software according to given specifications
- implementing graph algorithms
- applying these algorithms to solve graph-based problems
